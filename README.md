## Intro
Galaxy classification plays an important role in astrophysics, helping researchers understand the evolution and formation of galaxies. Using ML we can manage to classify galaxies by looking at their morphology.

## Data
The project uses galaxy images from Hubble Space Telescope [HST](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) and is supported by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) projects. I will be using galaxy features that has been preprocessed for analysis from ESA DataLabs.

## Method
1. Feature Extraction:
We will use techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from galaxy images.
2. Algorithms:
The project will implement several machine learning algorithms, including, Local Outlier Factor(LOF), KNN
