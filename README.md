# Galaxy classification



## Intro
Galaxy classification plays an important role in astrophysics, helping researchers understand the evolution and formation of galaxies. Using ML we can manage to classify galaxies by looking at their morphology.

Data
The project uses galaxy images from Hubble Space Telescope(HST). I will be using galaxy features that has been preprocessed for analysis.
